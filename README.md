# Constructor-Hangman
Hangman command-line game using constructor functions.

    Receives user input using the inquirer or prompt npm packages.


    Word.js: holds current word the user is going to guess

    Letter.js: Holds the letters guesed. Letter.js displays an underlying character, or an underscore, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. 

    Game should keep track of the user's remaining guesses and prompt the user if they would like to end the game if none remain.

    Each constructor function should be in it's own file and be exported and required wherever needed.
